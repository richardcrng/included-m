## Included M

The goals of Included M are:

1. **To improve Fellow experience.** Included has great content (e.g. through 101 packs). Mostly, it's static written content at the moment. What if we could present that content in a more modern way?
2. **To broaden impact beyond Fellows.** Included has had to turn down a lot of people. We can't give them the _full_ Fellow experience, but what if we could give them _something_?
3. **To strengthen the Included brand.** We're re-imagining how people learn venture and enter the industry. What if we had our own product to do that?

Enter **Included M**: a mobile-first web app that is designed to:

- amplify the reach of Included's content; and
- wrap up that content in engaging, bite-sized chunks.

> Why Included _M_? It represents both scale (M is the roman numeral for 1000) and an emphasis on being mobile-optimised.
