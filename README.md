The goals of Included M are:

1. **To improve Fellow experience.** Included has great content (e.g. through 101 packs). Mostly, it's static written content at the moment. What if we could present that content in a more modern way?
2. **To broaden impact beyond Fellows.** Included has had to turn down a lot of people. We can't give them the _full_ Fellow experience, but what if we could give them _something_?
3. **To strengthen the Included brand.** We're re-imagining how people learn venture and enter the industry. What if we had our own product to do that?

Enter [**Included M**](https://included-m.vercel.app): a mobile-first web app that is designed to:

- amplify the reach of Included's content; and
- wrap up that content in engaging, bite-sized chunks.

### Background

Even with the pilot cohort (IVC20), there was always the aspiration to create a learning pathway that went beyond the Fellowship.

This originally had a working title of _Included 1000_.

Now, it's being pushed forwards by [Richard](https://richard.ng), drawing heavy inspiration from the learning experience of [Quantic's mobile-first MBA](https://quantic.edu/).

> ðŸ’¡ The _M_ in Included M represents both scale (M is the roman numeral for 1000) and an emphasis on being mobile-optimised.

###Â How to contribute

You can:

- **Test it out** and report bugs / unexpected behaviour
- **Contribute to the web app** (React and TypeScript experience ideal, but I can teach bits)
