      - Let's look at an indicative example from the UK.
      - Less than {{1%}} of the UK population have degrees from the universities of Oxford and Cambridge.
      - "But, in *ascending order*, it's:"
      - "{{9%}} of founders"
      - "{{12%}} of tech firm CEOs"
      - "{{16%}} of VCs."

      - It goes far beyond university education too - to things which are so much more pervasive.
      - What proportion of UK investment roles in VC do you think are held by women?
    answers:
      - text: 50%
        isCorrect: false
        feedback: Well. No. Not really.
      - text: 30%
        isCorrect: false
        feedback: This is the proportion of women in VC across all roles - it's even smaller in investment roles specifically, though
      - text: 20%
        isCorrect: true
        feedback: That's right - just 20% of VC investment roles are held by women in the UK.
      - text: 13%
        isCorrect: false
        feedback: As it happens, this is the % of senior investment roles that are held by women, where the diversity problem is worst.
