      - At Included VC, we believe that talent is equally distributed - but opportunity is not.
      - For example, a study of almost 5,000 VC-funded startups found that a very clear 'typical team' emerged.
      - "To quote the report:"
      - The typical founding team across these 4,475 companies was a two person, "{{all male}}," "{{all white}}," U.S. {{university-educated}} team residing in {{Silicon Valley}}.

      - It's not just the US either.
      - Let's look at an indicative example from the UK.
      - Less than {{1%}} of the UK population have degrees from the universities of Oxford and Cambridge.
      - "But, in *ascending order*, it's:"
      - "{{9%}} of founders"
      - "{{12%}} of tech firm CEOs"
      - "{{16%}} of VCs."

      - It goes far beyond university education too - to things which are so much more pervasive.
      - What proportion of UK investment roles in VC do you think are held by women?
    answers:
      - text: 50%
        isCorrect: false
        feedback: Well. No. Not really.
      - text: 30%
        isCorrect: false
        feedback: This is the proportion of women in VC across all roles - it's even smaller in investment roles specifically, though
      - text: 20%
        isCorrect: true
        feedback: That's right - just 20% of VC investment roles are held by women in the UK.
      - text: 13%
        isCorrect: false
        feedback: As it happens, this is the % of senior investment roles that are held by women, where the diversity problem is worst.

    blocks:
      - When so few VC investment roles are held by women, it's no surprise that startup founding teams are predominantly male.
      - What proportion of UK VC deals do you think are made with _all-male_ founding teams?
    answers:
      - text: 89%
        isCorrect: false
        feedback: Close - this turns out to be the % of funding _value_ that goes to all-male teams, rather than the number of deals.
      - text: 83%
        isCorrect: true
        feedback: That's right - 83% of funded founding teams are _all-male_.
      - text: 17%
        isCorrect: false
        feedback: This is the proportion of _mixed_ teams. Yes, only 17% of founding teams are mixed...
